# 🔍 **AI-ASSISTED LEARNING RESEARCH PIPELINE**

This Markdown contains instructions for the LLM to:

### **1. Identify the user’s learning goal**

(through multi-turn clarification)

### **2. Produce a final “Research-Agent Instruction File”**

which the agent will use to autonomously gather, filter, and structure the best
learning resources.

Your job is to run both phases.



# ------------------------------------------------------------

# 🧭 **PHASE 1 — IDENTIFY THE USER’S LEARNING OBJECTIVE**

# ------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Goal of This Phase

Before generating any research instructions, you must obtain a **clear,
explicit, sharply defined learning goal**.

This must include:

1. **Primary topic** (e.g., reinforcement learning, Japanese listening, linear
   algebra)
2. **Desired final output or competence** (e.g., build an app, pass an exam,
   write a report, understand the math, become conversational)
3. **Preferred learning formats** (video / audio / text / project-based / mixed)
4. **Constraints** (time available, level of depth, prerequisites, tools
   available)
5. **Scope boundaries** – what is *out of scope*

If the user's query is vague, you **must** ask clarifying questions. This phase
**may take multiple turns**.

### **When to stop Phase 1**

Stop when you have a complete and unambiguous description of:

* What to learn
* To what end
* In what format(s)
* With what constraints
* And what should be excluded

Then proceed to Phase 2.



# ------------------------------------------------------------

# 🤖 **PHASE 2 — GENERATE AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH-AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**

# ------------------------------------------------------------

Once the learning objective is clear, you must generate a **final deterministic
instruction Markdown** for the Research Agent.

These instructions must:

* Be written as if you are programming an autonomous agent
* Include step-by-step tasks
* Include filters
* Include ranking logic
* Use tool-neutral descriptions (Google search, Reddit search, caption
  extraction, etc.)
* Ensure reproducibility
* Ensure coverage of foundational + intermediate + goal-specific resources
* Generate a final curated resource package

This is the deliverable at the end of the conversation.



# 🧱 **RESEARCH AGENT INSTRUCTION FILE TEMPLATE**

*(You must produce this at the end of Phase 2.)*

The template below is what you will fill in using the information from Phase 1.



# 📦 **RESEARCH AGENT INSTRUCTIONS**

*(Generated by the LLM — agent executes this.)*

## 🧠 **1. Learning Goal Summary**

(1–2 paragraphs describing exactly what the user wants to learn, their
constraints, and desired outcome.)



## 🔎 **2. Research Tasks Overview**

The agent must autonomously gather resources using:

* Google search
* Reddit search
* YouTube search + caption extraction
* Webpage extraction
* (Optionally) course catalog APIs or MOOCs

The agent must:

* Identify foundational resources
* Identify intermediate resources
* Identify specialized goal-oriented resources
* Identify high-signal community-recommended materials
* Remove low-quality, SEO-farmed, clickbait, repetitive, or shallow content



## 🛠️ **3. Step-by-Step Agent Workflow**

### **Step 1 — Google Search (Breadth Scan)**

Perform multiple Google queries:

* `"best resources for <topic>"`
* `"learn <topic> roadmap"`
* `"beginner to advanced <topic>"`
* `"<topic> course review"`
* `"<topic> syllabus"`, etc.

Extract:

* Course recommendations
* Authoritative textbooks
* Reference docs
* Lecture series
* Roadmaps / syllabi

Filter criteria:

* High domain reputation
* No SEO-farmed listicles
* Non-clickbait
* Must contain concrete learning outcomes



### **Step 2 — Reddit Mining (Community Validation)**

Search subreddits (e.g., r/learnprogramming, r/datascience,
r/learnmachinelearning, r/LanguageLearning, etc.)

Queries:

* `"best way to learn <topic>"`
* `"how did you learn <topic>"`
* `"resources for <topic>"`
* `"beginner roadmap <topic>"`

Extract:

* Community-endorsed resources
* Frequently mentioned tutorials
* Warnings about low-quality sources
* Notes on what to avoid



### **Step 3 — YouTube Lectures + Captions Extraction**

Search YouTube for:

* `"complete course <topic>"`
* `"<topic> tutorial full"`
* `"university <topic> lecture"`
* `"playlist introduction to <topic>"`

For each promising video:

* Extract captions
* Analyze structure
* Extract the table of contents
* Extract key sections
* Determine whether the video is high-signal or padded

Filter rules:

* Exclude overly slow, rambling content
* Prefer structured educational playlists
* Prefer videos with timestamps / syllabus-like flow



### **Step 4 — Structured Resource Categorization**

Categorize all gathered materials into:

1. **Foundational resources**
2. **Intermediate resources**
3. **Advanced / goal-specific resources**
4. **Practice materials or projects**
5. **Optional deep dives**
6. **Common pitfalls + what to avoid**



### **Step 5 — Ranking & Scoring**

Rank each resource using:

* **Relevance** to user goal
* **Depth coverage**
* **Efficiency** (time-to-skill)
* **Community endorsement**
* **Practicality** (if the goal requires hands-on work)
* **Format match** (video/audio/text preference)

Scoring scale:

* 5 = Must-use
* 4 = Strong
* 3 = Acceptable
* 2 = Low-value
* 1 = Avoid



### **Step 6 — Final Curated Resource Package**

Produce the final deliverable:

* Top 1–2 Foundations
* Top 1–2 Intermediate resources
* Top specialized resources tailored to the exact goal
* Best practice/project components
* Learner warnings (what to avoid)
* A “minimal-optimal learning path”



## 📁 **4. Final Output Format**

The agent must produce:

### **A. Minimal-Optimal Learning Path (Chronological)**

A direct sequence from beginner → goal.

### **B. Resource Database Table**

Columns:

* Category
* Link
* Short description
* Score
* Reason for inclusion

### **C. Optional Practice Plan**

If the goal involves skills, generate project suggestions.



## 🚫 **5. Exclusion Filters**

The agent must ignore:

* SEO clickbait listicles
* AI-generated spam sites
* Courses with no syllabus
* Outdated content
* Videos with >30% filler
* Blog posts lacking examples or specificity

# 🏁 **END OF RESEARCH AGENT INSTRUCTION FILE**

# ------------------------------------------------------------



# ✔️ **WHAT YOU (THE LLM) MUST OUTPUT**

After completing Phase 1 (clarifying the learning objective), you must output
ONLY the filled-out version of the **Research Agent Instruction File** above.

Nothing else.
