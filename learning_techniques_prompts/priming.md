# 📘 **PRIMING CONTENT GENERATOR**

**Input:** A raw lesson transcript
**Output:** High-level priming content that gives a fast understanding of the structure, sections, flow, and key ideas—without deep explanations or details.

The purpose of this prompt is to **emulate the priming process**, ensuring the learner forms a **mental map** of the lesson before deep study.

---

## ✅ **INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MODEL**

You must read the entire transcript and generate **priming content only**, following these principles:

### **🎯 Purpose of Priming**

1. Provide a **rapid overview** of the lesson’s structure.
2. Surface *what topics exist*, not the detailed explanations.
3. Give the learner a **mental model / puzzle outline** so deeper comprehension becomes faster.
4. Reduce learning time by helping the brain anticipate what’s coming.

Priming content should be **short, structural, high-signal, low-detail**, and focus on:

* **Section titles**
* **Core themes**
* **Major concepts**
* **Definitions only**
* **Examples only if they illustrate structure**
* **No deep reasoning, no formulas, no long explanations**

---

# 🧩 **OUTPUT FORMAT**

Produce the following sections *in order*:

---

## **1. Lesson Structure Map (Very High-Level Outline)**

A top-level outline of the entire lesson.
Use 1–2 levels of bullets only.
Focus on:

* Main sections
* Subsections
* Transitions in the lesson
* Major activities or demonstrations

This should read like a **table of contents extracted from the transcript**.

---

## **2. Key Concepts (Definitions Only)**

Extract all **important definitions** from the lesson.
Keep each definition to **1–2 short sentences**.
No deep explanation, no derivations.

Format:

* **Concept Name:** short definition

---

## **3. High-Level Concept Blocks**

Summaries of each major idea *without details*.
Each block should contain:

* What topic is covered
* What it connects to
* Why it appears in the lesson
* How it fits into the lesson’s overall structure

Each block = **3–4 sentences max**.

---

## **4. Structural Examples (Only if useful)**

Pick **1–3 examples** that:

* Help clarify how ideas fit together
* Illustrate relationships between concepts
* Show the progression of the lesson

Do **not** choose examples that require heavy explanation.

Limit each example to **3–5 sentences**.

---

## **5. Priming Questions (Before-Learning Quiz)**

Generate **5–10 simple questions** that highlight:

* The expected content
* The major sections
* The high-level ideas

These questions are **not** meant to be answered now—they simply tell the brain what to look for.

Use simple formats like:

* “What are the main steps of ___?”
* “Where does the lesson introduce ___?”
* “Which sections cover ___?”

---

## **6. Mental Model Summary (One-Page Map)**

A single cohesive summary that:

* Shows how the lesson flows from start → end
* Lists major steps or ideas in order
* Explains connections between parts

This must be **brief (200–300 words)** and focus on structure, not details.

---

# 🧠 **HOW TO USE THIS PRIMING CONTENT (For the Learner)**

Include this section exactly as written:

1. **Skim** the structure map (20–30 sec).
2. Read the **definitions** to learn the vocabulary (1–2 min).
3. Read the **concept blocks** to form a rough idea of each part (2–3 min).
4. Skim the **examples** to see how ideas connect.
5. Read the **priming questions**, but **don’t answer them** (30 sec).
6. Finish by reading the **mental model summary** (1–2 min).

Total priming time: **~5–8 minutes** for any lesson.

This primes your brain with:

* The structure
* The flow
* The conceptual map

…even before you actually learn the material.
