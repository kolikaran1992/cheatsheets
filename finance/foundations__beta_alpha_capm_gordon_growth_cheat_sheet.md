# 🚀 1. Ultra-Short Cheat Sheet

## ✅ Beta (β)

> *How much a stock moves compared to the market.*

Formula:
$$
\beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_{stock}, R_{market})}{\text{Var}(R_{market})}
$$

Interpretation:

* β = 1 → moves same as market
* β > 1 → more volatile than market
* β < 1 → calmer than market
* β < 0 → moves opposite market



## ✅ Alpha (α)

> *How much extra return a stock gives above what CAPM predicts.*

Formula:
$$
\alpha = R_{actual} - R_{CAPM}
$$

If:

* α > 0 → outperformed expectations
* α < 0 → underperformed



## ✅ CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)

$$ R = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f) $$

Where:

* $R$ = required return
* $R_f$ = risk-free rate
* $R_m$ = market return
* $β$ = stock risk



## ✅ Gordon Growth Model (Dividend Discount Model)

$$
P_0 = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
$$

Where:

* $P_0$ = fair price today
* $D_1$ = next year’s dividend
* $r$ = required return (often CAPM)
* $g$ = dividend growth rate



# 🎒 2. Explain Like I'm 10 (or you to a 5th grader)

### ✅ Beta

Imagine:

* Market = school playground
* Stock = you

If the playground gets noisy and you also get noisy: → β = 1

If the playground gets noisy and you get SUPER noisy: → β > 1 (you exaggerate
movements)

If the playground gets noisy and you stay calm: → β < 1 (you’re chill)

If playground gets noisy and you become quiet: → β < 0 (inverse)



### ✅ CAPM

Think:

* You lend your toy to someone
* You want something in return

You say:

🪙 "If I kept my toy safe at home, I’d get 1 candy (risk-free). But lending to
YOU is risky. I want extra candy."

CAPM tells you:

✅ How many extra candies you deserve for taking risk



### ✅ Alpha

After the trade:

CAPM said you should earn 3 candies You actually got 5 candies

→ You earned 2 candies extra = Alpha



### ✅ Gordon Growth Model

Imagine a magic goose that lays eggs every year

Price of goose today = eggs next year / (your required return – growth in eggs)

If eggs grow faster → goose is worth more



# 🧠 3. Investor-Level Usage

## ✅ Beta tells you:

✔ How your portfolio will behave in crashes ✔ Whether a stock is risky or
defensive

Examples:

* High beta stocks (β > 1.2): tech, startups, cyclicals

* Low beta stocks (β < 0.8): FMCG, utilities, pharma



## ✅ CAPM tells you:

✔ Minimum return you should demand ✔ Whether a stock is worth holding vs
risk-free

Example:

If CAPM required return = 9% and analysts expect only 6%

→ Not worth the risk



## ✅ Alpha tells you:

✔ Is this stock or fund actually skillful, or just lucky?

Example: Mutual fund returns 12% CAPM says required return was 14%

→ Fund manager actually underperformed → Marketing hides this



## ✅ Gordon Growth Model tells you:

✔ Whether dividend stocks are overpriced or cheap

Example: D1 = ₹5 r = 10% g = 5%

$$ P = 5/(0.10 - 0.05) = ₹100 $$

If market price = ₹150 → overpriced
